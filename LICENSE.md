4. OPEN SOURCE AND THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE
The SDK may be supplied by Sahha as part of a bundle with third party software that is licensed under other terms and conditions ("Third Party Software"), including but not limited to, software licensed under any form of open source licence meeting the Open Source Initiative’s Open Source Definition (http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php) ("Open Source Software"). Sahha is not responsible for any Third Party Software and your use of Third Party Software is subject to your compliance with the relevant terms and conditions that apply thereto.

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Subject to non-excludable applicable law, the SDK is provided on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Sahha disclaims all warranties, guarantees and conditions, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the SDK, including but not limited to implied warranties, guarantees or conditions of fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, title, quality, results, and non-infringement. You acknowledge that the SDK has not been developed to meet your individual requirements, including but not limited to, any particular cybersecurity requirements you might be subject to under law or otherwise, and that it is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the SDK as described in the Documentation meet your requirements. Sahha expressly disclaims any warranties of any kind with respect to the accuracy or functionality of the SDK, and with respect to the accuracy, validity and completeness of any information or features available through the SDK, and with respect to the quality or consistency of the SDK or results obtained through its use. Under no circumstances will Sahha be liable for any consequential, special, indirect, incidental or punitive damages whatsoever arising out of the use or inability to use the SDK, including but not limited to, liability for: (a) loss of profits, sales, business, or revenue; (b) business interruption; (c) loss of anticipated savings; (d) loss or corruption of data or information; (e) loss of business opportunity, goodwill or reputation; or (f) any other special, indirect or consequential loss, damage, charges or expenses, even if Sahha has been advised of the possibility of such loss, damage, charges or expenses. In no event will Sahha's maximum aggregate liability for loss and/or damage arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, an Sahha Platform and/or the SDK exceed the greater of the amount paid by you to Sahha for the SDK, if any, or USD50. The foregoing exclusions and limitations of liability set out in this paragraph apply even where a limited or exclusive remedy fails of its essential purposes and will apply to the extent permitted by law in any applicable jurisdiction. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude Sahha's liability that cannot be excluded or limited by applicable law. The Australian Consumer Law may imply certain non-excludable guarantees from Sahha into this Agreement. Where liability for breach of any such guarantee can be limited, Sahha's liability (if any) arising from any breach of the guarantee is limited: (a) with respect to the supply of goods, to the replacement or repair of the goods or the costs of resupply or replacement of the goods; and (b) with respect to services, to the supply of the services again or cost of re-supplying the services again. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Sahha, Sahha has no obligation to provide you with any support or maintenance in relation to the SDK or any Sahha Platform.

You: (a) agree that you have assessed the SDK as being suitable for your, your Applications' and your End Users’ requirements; (b) agree that to the maximum extent permitted by Law, you use the SDK at your sole risk; and (c) hereby irrevocably release Sahha from and against any claims that you might otherwise have against Sahha in connection with any information, that you, your personnel, your Applications or any End User may receive directly or indirectly from Sahha Platforms, the SDK or your Applications. As between you and Sahha, you are solely responsible for: (a) any healthcare or medical advice, treatment plans, suggestions, exercises and regimes that you provide or recommend to any End User; (b) the accuracy, efficacy and results of any health information (including, but not limited to, to the extent that any information from an Sahha Platform and/or the SDK constitutes health information) and advice, and for any clinical reports, health assessments, health care plans, treatment plans, clinical advice, suggestions, exercises, regimes, recommendations, services, clinical or remedial procedures, prescriptions and health services that you provide to any person (each, a "Healthcare Service"), and for any claims arising in connection with any Healthcare Service that you supply or fail to supply.

Following any termination of this Agreement, the Licence will terminate and you must immediately uninstall and cease all use of the SDK, and destroy all copies of it in your possession or control. All paragraphs of this Agreement, other than paragraph 1, will survive termination.
 
10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This Agreement sets out the full extent of Sahha's obligations and liabilities in respect of the SDK. Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, there are no conditions, warranties, representations or other terms, express or implied, that are binding between you and Sahha. Any condition, warranty, representation or other term concerning the SDK and which might otherwise be implied into, or incorporated in, this Agreement whether by statute, common law or otherwise, is excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 
11. VARIATION OF AGREEMENT
Sahha may update the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time. Your continued use of the SDK following such time shall constitute your acceptance of this Agreement, as varied. If you do not wish to accept the terms and conditions of the Agreement (as varied) you must immediately stop using and accessing the SDK, this Agreement will terminate and the termination provisions of paragraph 9 will apply. 

12. VARIATIONS OF THE SDK AND Sahha SYSTEMS
Sahha may at any time, and for any reason, modify, update, change or enhance the SDK ("Updates") or any Sahha Platform in Sahha’s sole and exclusive discretion. Any failure to promptly implement such Updates may result in your Applications becoming incompatible with one or more Sahha Platforms. 

13.  OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS
Sahha may assign its rights, or novate its rights and obligations, under this Agreement to another organisation. You may only assign your rights, or novate your rights and obligations, under this Agreement to another person or organisation if Sahha agrees in writing and any purported assignment or novation in breach of this sentence is void. If Sahha fails to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this SDK, or if Sahha does not enforce its rights against you, or if Sahha delays in doing so, that will not mean that Sahha has waived its rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If Sahha does waive a default by you, it will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that it will automatically waive any later default by you. If any court or competent authority decides that any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining terms and conditions will remain in full force and effect. This Agreement, its subject matter and its formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims related to it) are governed by the law in force in New South Wales, Australia. You and Sahha both irrevocably agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New South Wales, Australia and any courts of appeal therefrom, with respect to any proceedings concerning this Agreement and the SDK.
